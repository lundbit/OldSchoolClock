/*  Test connection between Atom and Git

***This procedure assumes you have established a token or SSH
between your Atom and Github accounts. Both Atom and Github have specific steps
on how to set this up through your console.  It's worth it to avoid the console
form asking for password each time.***

2)  Noted https for repo
